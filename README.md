## How to run the project
- npm run dev:json-server
- npm run dev

## Task:

- On the root page create a button (use Shadcn, align by a center of screen) with title 'Make congrants'
- Create `congrats` route. Add necessary files to render the content (up to you)
- On the `congrats` page do the next:

  > > 1.  Fetch data (`SSR only`. Make a `GET` request to the `(http://localhost:3000/api/rating)` route) **!(make sure you're running the app on the 3000th port)!**
  > > 2.  Show the data (sort by `rank`) as a table (use Shadcn, align by a center of screen)
  > > 3.  Create a form (use Shadcn, put below the table) with a simple validation (use zod (recommended) or any other validation lib) with only `2 input fields` (`Name` and `Time`) and `1 button` (`Push result`)
  > > 4.  Send a `POST` request to the `(http://localhost:3000/api/rating)` route with your success time ( try to be honest :) ) and revalidate the necessary path to see the result

## P.S.: UI/UX is up to you, but the better it is, the better the overall result will be
