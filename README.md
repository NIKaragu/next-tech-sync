## Task:

- On the root page create a button (use Shadcn, align by a center of screen) with title 'Make congrants'
- Create `congrats` route. Add necessary files to render the page (up to you)
- On the congrats page do the next:

  > > 1.  Fetch data (SSR only. Make a GET request to the `api/rating` route)
  > > 2.  Show the data (sort by rank) as a table (use Shadcn, align by a center of screen)
  > > 3.  Create a form (use Shadcn, put under the list) without any validation (but if you have extra time you can try making a simple implementation (use zod)) with only 2 input fields (`Name` and `Time`) and one button (`Push result`)
  > > 4.  Send a POST request to the `api/rating` route with your success time (ask interviewer) and revalidate the necessary path to see the result
